🚀 Excited to Share Our ASL Recognition & Next Word Prediction Project! 🤖✨
Combining Computer Vision & NLP, this project aims to make communication more inclusive and accessible by:
 ✅ Recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time.
 ✅ Predicting the next word to assist in seamless sentence formation.
💡 Key Features:
 🔹 Real-time ASL Recognition using Computer Vision.
 🔹 Next Word Prediction for intuitive communication.
 🔹 User-Friendly Interface for accessibility.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
 🔸 Mediapipe for ASL recognition.
 🔸 Hidden Markov Model (HMM) & NLP for word prediction.
 🔸 Flask for seamless integration.
🚀 Future Enhancements:
 🔹 Expanding the ASL dataset for more gestures.
 🔹 Adding sentence-level predictions for better accuracy.
 🔹 Developing a mobile-friendly version for wider accessibility.
This project has been an incredible learning journey, improving my Deep Learning, NLP, and AI integration skills. Would love to hear your thoughts! 💬
